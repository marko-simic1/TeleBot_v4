## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Customize `telebot_server.py` to suit your specific robot:

- **Data Scaling**: Adjust how the received joystick data is scaled.
- **Data Transmission**: Define how data is sent to your robot's control systems.

**Example**: In `telebot_server_turtlesim.py`:

- Processes joystick input.
- Scales data for [Turtlesim](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlesim).
- Publishes commands to control the Turtlesim simulation.

```python
# telebot_server_turtlesim.py snippet

def handle_joystick_data(data):
    scaled_data = scale_data_for_turtlesim(data)
    publish_to_turtlesim(scaled_data)
```
